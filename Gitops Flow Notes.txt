I set up a full GitOps workflow using ArgoCD and Kubernetes.
Basically, the idea is that Git controls everything, not me.

I first created a K3s Kubernetes cluster on my EC2 and installed ArgoCD on it.
Then I pushed all my Kubernetes YAML files (namespace, deployment, service) into a GitHub repo.

After that, I connected ArgoCD to the repo.
So now ArgoCD keeps watching my GitHub repository 24/7.

Whenever I change anything in Git like I changed replicas from 2 to 3 —
ArgoCD immediately sees that change, marks the app as “OutOfSync,”
and automatically updates the cluster to match whatever is in Git.

So the flow is:

I push a change → ArgoCD detects it → ArgoCD applies it to Kubernetes → Cluster updates automatically.

I don’t manually run kubectl apply.
